limnotools
==========

A few helper tools for data analysis of aquatic systems. The most essential functions of this package are now included in package ''marelac'' that is available from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/package=marelac). Therefore, development of "limnotools" has been terminated. This repository serves for conservation and keeping old scripts running. Use with care!
